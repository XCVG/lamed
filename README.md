# LAzy Map Editor

A very quick-and-dirty map editor to make mapping for Collapsar (Heroine Dusk engine) less tedious.

# HTML5?

Yes. It'll be quicker this way. Eventually I'll probably turn this into a nw.js app so it can have handy things like proper saving.

# Acknowledgements

Clint Bellanger created Heroine Dusk and licensed it GPLv3. Collapsar is based on that codebase but I've made alterations to the map format so this probably won't work with the original codebase anymore. 

jQuery and jQuery UI, license included. To be honest, these probably shouldn't be included in the package itself, but I'm not using a CDN for something that might be run locally.
